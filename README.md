# DAKA - Daily Activity Keeping App

This app will allow a user to set their multiple goals, check in their progress each day, and visualize their cumulative progress. Users need to keep checking in their tasks on this app each day to maintain the task streaks, otherwise they fail their task streaks.

## Group 8 team members

## Minimal Goals -- these are things your app must do

User should be able to start and modify their task streak:
- Setting time range (e.g. beginning time, end time)
- Setting their goals (e.g. read for an hour, walk for 30 minutes)
- Setting the frequency that the goal is expected to be completed (e.g. twice a day)

App should have features:
- Notification feature to notify user if they are about to fail their task streak.
- Count-down system to show users how many days they have left on their streaks/current progress.

## Stretch Goals -- these are additional functionality that might earn extra points

We have identified the following stretch goals:
- A calendar that the user can select which date the user wants to view, instead of only
the current day the user is on.
- An Award mechanism that awards users by their progress. 
- The App page will appear growing animals/plants by how many days that users keep up
